# About The Project

In the era of digital transformation, online education and training are becoming integral parts of the global education system. This project is designed to meet the growing demand for applications and tools that facilitate direct interaction between instructors and learners with educational content and knowledge assessments.

## Objectives
The primary objective of this project is to develop a web application using ASP.NET Core MVC technology that allows users to create and participate in online quizzes. Specifically, the project aims to:
* **Quiz Creation**: Enable users to create quizzes by adding questions and customizing settings such as points per question and categorizing the quiz.
* **Participation in Quizzes**: Allow learners to take pre-created quizzes by answering questions and automatically receive scores upon completion.
* **Account Management**: Users can register and log in to manage their personal accounts, view test history, and track results.
* **Statistics and Reporting**: Collect data from quizzes and provide statistical information on test results to help instructors and learners assess progress and learning efficiency.
